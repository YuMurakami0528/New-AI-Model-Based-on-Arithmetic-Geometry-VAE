# New-AI-Model-Based-on-Arithmetic-Geometry-VAE

This is a high-level overview of how these concepts can be combined and a starting point for your implementation in Python.

## Description
1. Number theory: Number theory can be utilized in the AI model by representing data in the form of number sequences or numerical patterns. Prime numbers or other mathematical properties can be used to encode information.
2. Geometry: Incorporate geometric concepts such as shapes, transformations, and distances to represent and manipulate the data. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can be employed to uncover hidden structures and patterns in the data.
3. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs are unsupervised learning models that can generate new data by learning a continuous latent representation of the input data. They consist of an encoder and a decoder network.

## Process
1. Preprocess the data: Convert your input data into a suitable representation that incorporates number theory and geometry. You might want to represent data points as numerical sequences or geometric shapes.
2. Create a custom VAE: Design a VAE with a custom encoder and decoder architecture that can handle the data representation from step 1. The encoder should learn the continuous latent representation of the input data, while the decoder should generate new data points.
3. Train the model: Train the VAE on the preprocessed data to learn the latent representation and generate new data points.
4. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as reconstruction error or generative quality.

# Introduction

`import torch`

`import torch.nn as nn`

`import torch.optim as`

# Define custom VAE architecture
`class CustomVAE(nn.Module):`
    
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, latent_size):
        super(CustomVAE, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            # Add custom layers for encoding
        )
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            # Add custom layers for decoding
        )

    def encode(self, x):
        # Implement the encoding process
        pass

    def decode(self, z):
        # Implement the decoding process
        pass

    def forward(self, x):
        z_mean, z_logvar = self.encode(x)
        z = self.reparameterize(z_mean, z_logvar)
        return self.decode(z), z_mean, z_logvar

# Preprocess the data
`def preprocess_data(data):
    # Implement preprocessing steps
    pass`

# Loss function
`def vae_loss(recon_x, x, z_mean, z_logvar):
    # Implement the VAE loss function
    pass`

# Training the model
`def train(model, data_loader, optimizer, epochs):
    # Implement the training loop
    pass`

# Load and preprocess the data
`data = # Load your data here
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)`

# Create the custom VAE model
`input_size = # Determine the input size based on preprocessed_data
hidden_size = 128
latent_size = 64
model = CustomVAE(input_size, hidden_size, latent_size)`

# Set up the optimizer
`optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())`

# Train the model
`epochs = 50`
`train(model, preprocessed_data, optimizer, epochs)`

# Dataset Example

In this example, we'll generate data points representing circles with radii being prime numbers.

`import numpy as np`
`import sympy`

`def generate_circle(radius, num_points):
    angles = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, num_points)
    x = radius * np.cos(angles)
    y = radius * np.sin(angles)
    return np.column_stack((x, y))`

`def generate_prime_circles(num_primes, points_per_circle):
    prime_radii = [sympy.nextprime(n) for n in range(num_primes)]
    circles = [generate_circle(radius, points_per_circle) for radius in prime_radii]
    return np.vstack(circles)`

`num_primes = 10`
`points_per_circle = 100`
`data = generate_prime_circles(num_primes, points_per_circle)`
`data_normalized = (data - data.min(axis=0)) / (data.max(axis=0) - data.min(axis=0))`

In this example, we generate num_primes circles with radii being prime numbers. Each circle contains points_per_circle equally spaced points along its circumference. The dataset consists of the 2D coordinates of these points. We then normalize the data to bring it into the range [0, 1]. You can use the generated data_normalized as input to the VAE implementation provided earlier.
